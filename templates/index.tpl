      If you're reaching this page then Ori appears to be setup correctly.<br>
      (Databases may not work, but everything else appears fine).<br><br>
      Not the page you were expecting? <a href="https://github.com/BookOfOrigin/Ori" target="_blank">Click here for Ori documentation</a><br><br>
      At some point I'd like to replace this page with a system that actually tests and finds problems.
